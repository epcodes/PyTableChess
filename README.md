# PyTableChess
PyTableChess is a free openings table and engine in development for you to use! No license, although it may be registered, revoking some permissions.

It currently has only book openings, but this will be updated soon.

PyTable Openings (book.py) was made with the idea of helping chess bots automate their openings.
